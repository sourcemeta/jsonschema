![JSON Schema](./assets/banner.png)

The command-line tool for working with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org),
the world most popular schema language. It is a comprehensive solution for
maintaining **repositories of schemas** and ensuring their quality, both during
local development and when running on CI/CD pipelines. For example:

- Ensure your schemas are valid
- Unit test your schemas against valid and invalid instances
- Enforce consistent indentation and keyword ordering in your schema files
- Detect and fix common JSON Schema anti-patterns
- Inline external references for conveniently distributing your schemas

Usage
-----

The functionality provided by the JSON Schema CLI is divided into commands. The
following pages describe each command in detail. Additionally, running the JSON
Schema CLI without passing a command will print convenient reference
documentation:

- [`jsonschema validate`](./docs/validate.markdown)
- [`jsonschema metaschema`](./docs/metaschema.markdown) (ensure a schema is valid)
- [`jsonschema test`](./docs/test.markdown) (write unit tests for your schemas)
- [`jsonschema fmt`](./docs/format.markdown)
- [`jsonschema lint`](./docs/lint.markdown)
- [`jsonschema bundle`](./docs/bundle.markdown) (for inlining remote references in a schema)
- [`jsonschema frame`](./docs/frame.markdown) (for debugging references)
- [`jsonschema compile`](./docs/compile.markdown) (for internal debugging)
- [`jsonschema identify`](./docs/identify.markdown)
- [`jsonschema canonicalize`](./docs/canonicalize.markdown) (for static analysis)
- [`jsonschema encode`](./docs/encode.markdown) (for binary compression)
- [`jsonschema decode`](./docs/decode.markdown)

Installation
------------

The JSON Schema CLI is written using C++ and [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and
supports macOS, Windows, and GNU/Linux. Under the hood, it relies on the
powerful [JSON Toolkit](https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsontoolkit) library.

### From Homebrew

```sh
brew install sourcemeta/apps/jsonschema
```

### From GitHub Actions

```yaml
- uses: sourcemeta/jsonschema@vX.Y.Z
```

Where `X.Y.Z` is replaced with the desired version. For example:

```yaml
- uses: sourcemeta/jsonschema@v4.3.0
# Then use as usual
- run: jsonschema fmt path/to/schemas --check
```

### From NPM

```sh
npm install --global @sourcemeta/jsonschema
```

### From GitHub Releases

We publish precompiled binaries for every supported platform to [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema/releases), including a
[continuous](https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema/releases/tag/continuous)
that is updated on every commit from the main branch.

For convenience, we also provide a POSIX shell script capable of installing the
latest pre-built binaries, which you can run as follows:

```sh
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema/main/install -H "Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate")"
```

### From Dockerfile

You can compile the JSON Schema CLI inside a container and run it with Docker
as follows:

```sh
docker build -t jsonschema .
```

Then, you run the JSON Schema CLI by mounting the desired directory as
`/workspace` as follows:

```sh
docker run --interactive --volume "$PWD:/workspace" jsonschema lint --verbose myschema.json

# You can optionally add this to your .alias (or similar) file:
# alias jsonschema="docker run --interactive --volume \"$PWD:/workspace\" jsonschema"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to NOT allocate a pseudo-TTY when running the CLI through Docker
> (i.e. the `--tty`/`-t` option) as it might result in line ending
> incompatibilities between the container and host, which will affect
> formatting. Plus a TTY is not required for running a tool like the JSON
> Schema CLI.

### Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sourcemeta/jsonschema
cd jsonschema
cmake -S . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
cmake --build ./build --config Release --parallel 4
cmake --install ./build --prefix <prefix> \
  --config Release --verbose --component sourcemeta_jsonschema
```

Where `<prefix>` can be any destination prefix of your choosing, such as `/opt`
or `/usr/local`.
